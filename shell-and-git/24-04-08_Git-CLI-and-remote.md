# Cheatsheet (from Andrea's thread in Slack)

## Once

# In the shell

git init # create a repo (once per project)

## don't forget to add a .gitignore file

git remote add origin <ssh-path-to-github>

## For each feature

# In the shell

git switch -c <branchname> # create and switch to new branch

git add <file> # add a file to the stage

git status # check, if everything is ok

git commit -m "<message>" # commit your changes

git push -u origin <branchname> # push to GitHub

# continue on GitHub

## On GitHub

- Create a pull request for that branch (to merge it into main)
- Send a link to the changed files to your team
- Get a code review
- Optional: implement changes, push again to update pull request
- Merge and delete the branch on GitHub
- Continue in the shell

## Again in the shell

git switch main

git pull # get the merged commits in your local main

git branch -d <oldbranchname> # delete the merged branch
